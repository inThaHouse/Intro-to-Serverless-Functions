## Intro & Overview

- No, it does not mean no servers. Most server setups, configs, boilerplates etc.. are handled by a third party instead.
- I need a server but I don't want to deal with a server. This is where serverless functions come in handy.
- We send our business logics to our server provider and they deal with the mundane server stuff.
- You get the benefits of a server without the headaches of managing them.
- This course will look at:

  1.  How to load data using serverless functions.

  3.  How to send data to serverless functions.
  4.  How to save data sent to serverless functions.
